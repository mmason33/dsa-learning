# A Programmers Guide to Computer Science

### Notes
- Algorithms are more general than programs. Programs usually implement Algorithms.
- Asymptotic runtime - The rate at which the runtime grows compared to the size of the input.

- Linear Algorithms - `O(n)` - total runtime is proportional to the number of items processed
- Quadratic Algorithms - `O(n^2) - Doing O(n) work O(n) times` - compare every element of collection to every other element in a collection

- All algorithms where the runtime is proportional to the size of the input raised to some power are know as `polynomial` algorithms.
